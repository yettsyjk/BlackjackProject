# Blackjack Project

- Created by Software Developer Yettsy Jo Knapp. Denver, CO.
## Application Overview
  - Use classes to create a functional command line blackjack game.
  - Implement methods and fields to store data you think you would need during a blackjack game.

## UML Diagram
    - See UML Diagram in src directory
## User Story #1
  - Create a class structure that mimics a deck of cards. Remember decks as well as hands are made up of cards. Feel free to create the structure in any way you see fit.

  - Your card and deck implementations should NOT be coupled to Blackjack; you should be able to reuse them to implement a poker or bridge game application.

## User Story #2
  - Add methods and fields to your classes that mimic the functionality of shuffling and dealing a deck of cards. Remember that when a card is dealt you have to remove it from the current deck. You should be able to print out a shuffled deck to the terminal.

## User Story #3
  - Deal two hands of cards - one to a Dealer and another to a Player. Allow the players to Hit (add cards to their hand) or Stay (not add cards to their hand) in accordance to the rules of blackjack.

  - Do not worry about the multiple values for Ace until your basic game logic is working. Assume they are either 1 or 11 to start.

## User Story #4
  - The Dealer's decisions are based on game logic in the program.

  - The Dealer must decide to Hit or Stay based on the rules of Blackjack: if the Dealer's hand total is below 17, the Dealer must Hit; if the hand total is 17 or above, the Dealer must Stay.

## User Story #5
  - Determine the winner of each round by implementing the remaining rules of Blackjack (such as going over 21) and comparing hand values.
